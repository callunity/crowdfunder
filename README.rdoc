== Seat Yourself

A Bitmaker Labs assignment to create a basic clone of OpenTable. Topics covered include:
* More indepth model associations
* PostgreSQL
* Pry
* Working in a group
* User story creation, project mapping, and mockups
* Callbacks 

Assumptions:
- Each Restaurant has 100 seats available (though we've limited this to 10 for testing purposes).
- Each Reservation lasts for 1 hour.
- Reservations can only be made on the hour.
- Restaurant hours are 11amâ€“8pm, 7 days a week.

Areas for future development:
- Allow for bookings on the half-hour.
- Add a numerical rating system.
- Add more filtering (rating, price, amenities).
- Show daily deals for restaurants.
- Use ActsAsTaggable for types of cuisine, meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

## Minor fixes:
- normalize phone number input so that it only accepts 10 digits (3-3-4 fields? "write it like this"?)
